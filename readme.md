# Single page and API assignment

I started by creating the weather forcest container and created an API key to be able
to get a geolocation data from the visitor (it works best in chrome)
but then I stumble across the local storage form and I wanted to try it out and adter I did that I stumbled across how to upload a file so I just had to try it as well.

The most chanalling part was to do a single page, though it might look simple afterwards but when I started to code it I thought it was a bit weird, but I like it now!

..the only problem I have is with the file upload in the photo gallery, sometimes the photo uploads and somethimes it doesnt.. I need some more time to see what the problem is, but anyway the photo upload was just a fun thing to add on the page :)
